# WeatherApp
This is a mobile application that allows users to conveniently check basic, detailed, and forecast weather information for their favorite cities. The app not only stores weather data for offline use but also provides the option for users to set the refresh frequency. Additionally, the app is compatible with tablets. All the weather data in the application is obtained from the [OpenWeatherMap Api](https://openweathermap.org/api). </br></br>
